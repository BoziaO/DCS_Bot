## Known Security Considerations

### Discord Token Security

- Implement proper access controls
- Regular backups with encryption
- Monitor for unusual database activity

### Rate Limiting

- Discord API has rate limits
- Implement proper rate limiting in the bot
- Handle rate limit responses gracefully
- Monitor for rate limit violations

### Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention in web interfaces
- Command injection prevention
